    - Finished drawing out the layout of the pannel on paper
    (1.5 Hours)

    - Worked on creating the pannel in HTML & CSS
    (2 Hours)

August 20, 2019:
    - Started work to convert to a ReactJS app, started with tutorials and research.
    (2 Hours)

    - Tried to create first component, which would be a crossover button, which took
    4 hours to get an image in appear in ReactJS
    (4.5 Hours)

August 21, 2019:
    - Changed the componet which was going to be just a crossover button to the entire
    Suscon interlocking. Deciding that each interlocking will be it's own component.
    (3 Hours)

August 23, 2019:
    - Tried to figure out how to change an image in ReactJS, which ended up being a
    real big pain, having to import each image file similar to importing a scrip file.
    This solution seems weird but it's the only way I've been getting this to work so far.
    (4 Hours)

August 24, 2019:
    - Started to get all the crossover buttons working, and changing the image based on clicks,
    did this for both Suscon and Mill
    (1 Hour)

    - Converted what I did for the crossover buttons to use the 'state' object which is part of 
    a ReactJS Component to more closely follow the conventions of ReactJS
    (2 Hours)

    -

August 25, 2019:
    - Set up the click function for the signals in Suscon
    (0.5 Hours)

    - Changed the setup so all the components that make up the Main Line section are wrapped in one
    component, this will make it eaiser for passing information from the components to the CTC controller
    both ways. 
    (0.5 Hours)

    - Changed all the track block colors to be based off the state in their component class.
    (0.25 Hours)

    - Setup the beginnings of the CTC Controller class which will act as the backend to controll all the 
    train movements, also created a ctc_block class which is be a instance for each track block on the railroad
    (0.75 Hours)

    - Tested out have the informmation in the CTC Controller class change the state of the MainLine component
    by using the props property that is built into react to pass the status of 2 blocks into the component itself.
    Luckily it works, and I now have the ability CTC Controller change the pannel.
    (0.5 Hours)

August 26, 2019:
    - Changed how to pass an object as props in the ReactJS component, instead of a variable for each piece of
    information that needs to be passed
    (0.5 Hours)

    - Created a script for the Suscon interlocking to controll the train movements, and started to make this class
    change the state of the UI and have the changes reflected in either the ReactJS component or the JS script
    (1.5 Hours)

    - Got the ReactJS component to send it's changes up to the script class for the interlocking, and having the 
    changes in the the script be reflecting in the Component, at this point the data is being sent both ways for 
    the curent status of the crossovers in the interlocking
    (1 Hour)

August 27, 2019:

    class
